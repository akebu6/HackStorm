Hacks for Hacker MLH Hackathon submission

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
From a number of the hackathons that the team members have taken part in, finding an idea to build for the hackathon is always one of the most challenging as well as having a place where you can easily find resources to help you with your project. The team saw this as an opportunity to create a platform that allows hackers to generate ideas from simply filling in a few inputs and also have access to all the learning resources such as videos and blogs in one place.
